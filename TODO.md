# TODO

- 50% after 17min not finished on 8 cores



- Only load a few percent of the data. (ich habs bei mri gelaunched, das hat ewig gebraucht, also w√ºrde erst mit so 5% der data anfangen um model selection usw zu machen)

- Do a good model selection with random grid search 

- Advanced: look into kernel low rank approx methods, there is probably a package for that already
